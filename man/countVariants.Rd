\title{Count variants in a VCF file}
\usage{
countVariants(filename, regions)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{A character string specifying the path to the VCF file (e.g., `"data/sample.vcf.gz"`).
The file may be compressed with bgzip and must have a corresponding `.tbi` index file if `regions` are used.}

\item{regions}{An optional character vector of genomic regions to restrict the count, formatted as `"chr:start-end"` 
(e.g., `"chr2:10000-20000"`). If omitted, the entire file is scanned.}
}
\value{
A single integer representing the number of variants found in the file or specified regions.
}
\description{
Efficiently counts the number of variant records in a VCF file, optionally limited to specific genomic regions.
This function supports both plain-text and bgzipped VCF files with an accompanying Tabix index (`.tbi`).
}
\details{
When using the `regions` parameter, the regions must exactly match those indexed in the `.tbi` file. Use getRegions
to inspect which regions are supported. Providing unsupported regions will result in an error such as:
`"Mismatch between regions and .tbi file ! Aborting"`.

This function does not load variant content into memory, and is suitable for large-scale file scanning.

filename <- system.file("extdata", "example.vcf.gz", package = "readVCF")
