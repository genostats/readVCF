\title{Open a VCF file for line-by-line reading}
\usage{
openVCF(filename, regions)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{A character string specifying the path to the VCF file (can be `.vcf` or `.vcf.gz`).
The file must be tabix-indexed if regions are specified.}

\item{regions}{An optional character vector of genomic regions to extract (e.g., `"19:320000-700000"`). 
If missing, the entire file is accessible.}
}
\value{
An object of class `VCFReader` containing:
\describe{
  \item{filename}{The original file path.}
  \item{xptr}{An external pointer to the internal C++ reader.}
}
}
\description{
Opens a VCF file and returns a `VCFReader` object that allows efficient, low-level access to its contents line by line.
This is particularly useful for large VCF files where reading everything into memory is not feasible.
}
\details{
The returned object is of class `VCFReader` and can be used with various functions from the package to access VCF content.
}
\examples{
filename <- system.file("extdata", "example.vcf.gz", package = "readVCF")
reader <- openVCF(filename)
getFormats(reader)  # e.g., "GT", "DS", "AD", ...

# Iterate over a region
reader <- openVCF(filename, "19:320000-700000")
while (VCFnext(reader)) {
  line <- getLine(reader, "DS")
  print(head(line$values))
}
