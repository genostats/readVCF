\title{Read genotype matrix from a VCF file}
\usage{
read.vcf.genotypes(filename, regions)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{A character string giving the path to the VCF file (can be gzipped and tabix-indexed).}

\item{regions}{An optional character vector of genomic regions to extract (e.g., `"19:320000-700000"`).
If omitted, the entire file is processed.}
}
\value{
An integer matrix with:
\describe{
  \item{Rows:}{Sample IDs (individuals).}
  \item{Columns:}{Variant IDs (e.g., rsIDs from the VCF).}
  \item{Values:}{Genotypes coded as integers (typically 0, 1, 2). Missing values may appear as `NA`.}
}
}
\description{
Reads genotype data from a VCF file and returns it as an integer matrix. By default, all variants in the file are read,
unless a subset of genomic regions is specified..
}
\examples{
filename <- system.file("extdata", "example.vcf.gz", package = "readVCF")
genos <- read.vcf.genotypes(filename)

# Display matrix dimensions
print(dim(genos))

# Display first 5 individuals and first 5 variants
print(genos[1:5, 1:5])
